This repository is used to config vim on a new machine.

Notes:

1) pathogen.vim usage:
    a. Install in ~/.vim/autoload (~\vimfiles\autoload on Windows)
    b. Add: call pathogen#infect() in vimrc
    c. Put other plugins in ~/.vim/bundle (unzip/untar/svn-checkout/git-clone)
    d. To generate help files, type :call pathogen#helptags() in vim

2) uncomment the font settings for each OS in the bottom of vimrc

3) FOR WINDOWS USERS:
    At least you need linux's find, echo, grep, ctags, cscope
    You can find them in either cygwin or msys

    Take a look at cygwin_commands_for_windows.7z

    rename find to gfind and put it in your PATH
    rename echo to gecho and put it in you PATH
    put grep in your PATH
    put ctags in your PATH
    put cscope in your PATH

4) If you want to use fullscreen options:
    a) macvim already supports it
    b) linux users: install compizconfig-settings-manager and compiz-plugins-extra
                    and enable Extra WM Actions. After that, set a shortcut to 
                    Toggle Full-screen action.
