This repository is used to config vim on a new machine.

Notes:

1) pathogen.vim usage:
    a. Install in ~/.vim/autoload (~\vimfiles\autoload on Windows)
    b. Add: call pathogen#infect() in vimrc
    c. Put other plugins in ~/.vim/bundle (unzip/untar/svn-checkout/git-clone)
    d. To generate help files, type :call pathogen#helptags() in vim

2) Please change vimrc and dbs.vim's fileformat in different OSs
set fileformat=UNIX|DOS|MAC
:w

Please take a look at vimrc's Line 133, you need to modify it a little bit due to which operating system you are using.
